# Runaway Anteater
A 2D scrolling-and-obstacle-dodging game based on the activity on Ring Road on UCI's campus.

This game was created during the 2015 Winter Quarter Game Jam hosted by the Video Game Development Club at UC Irvine. We used Unity 4.6 for development, with C# as the scripting language.
